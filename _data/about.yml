    ## History

    When Cheryl Netterfield worked for the Canadian Armed Forces, she was
    concerned that the health care to soldiers with complex issues was not
    optimal. She discovered that valuable information was hidden in the medical
    files of the various care providers but never really accessed. During
    interdisciplinary case conferences, it was evident that the sharing of
    information for the care was of the patient was not efficient.


    POMMe-Health was created to address the issue of inefficient provider and
    patient communication and collaboration.


    POMMe stands for “Patient Outcome Management and Measurement”. The app
    provides an adjunct tool for health care providers to work better
    collaboratively and thereby, enhance patient outcomes.


    POMMe-Health, Inc is headquartered in Ottawa, Ontario.
