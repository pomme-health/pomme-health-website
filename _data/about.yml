  historyText: When Cheryl Netterfield worked for the Canadian Armed Forces, she was concerned that the health care to soldiers with complex issues was not optimal. She discovered that valuable information was hidden in the medical files of the various care providers but never really accessed. During interdisciplinary case conferences, it was evident that the sharing of information for the care was of the patient was not efficient. POMMe-Health was created to address the issue of inefficient provider and patient communication and collaboration. POMMe stands for “Patient Outcome Management and Measurement”. The app provides an adjunct tool for health care providers to work better collaboratively and thereby, enhance patient outcomes. POMMe-Health, Inc is headquartered in Ottawa, Ontario.
